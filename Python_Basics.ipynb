What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n","  - Python is a high level,interpreter,general purpose programming language.\n","    It is popular because:-\n","    - It has a large library and third-party module.\n","    - It has simple, readable syntax.\n","    - It has a strong community support.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","  - It is a program that executes python code line-by-line.\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","  - Pre-defined keywords are the reserved keywords in python that have special meanings and purposes.\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","  - No keywords can never be used as variables names in python because they are already reserved by the python for some general or specific purpose.\n","5. What is mutability in Python ?\n","  - Mutablility in python means that the whatever the content in the object can be updated or changed after creation.      \n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","- This is because the lists are designed for dynamic data handling as we can add,delete and update the data that's why mutable while the tuple are designed to store and handle fixed data we cannot update the content once created that's why immutable.\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","  - The \"==\" operator is used to compare the data of two or more objects.\n","  - On other hand, \"is\" operator is used to compare the identities, it is used to checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n","8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n","  - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n","    - and → True if both conditions are True.\n","    - or → True if at least one condition is True.\n","    - not → Reverses the logical value (True → False, False → True)\n","9. What is type casting in Python ?\n","  - Type casting in python refers to the conversion of a variable from one data type to other data type.\n","  - For Example: a = \"22\" , b = 20 now if we want to sum up these two variables by simply writing a + b without type casting \"a\" into \"int\" data type , it returns an error. But if we type cast \"a\" into \"int\" data type as int(a) + b , then it return 42 as an answer.\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","  - Implicit casting: is when python automatically converts data types during operations.\n","  - Explicit casting: is when user manually convert data types using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","  - Conditional statements control the flow of code execution by executing only those statements for which the certain conditions returns true.\n","12. How does the elif statement work ?\n","  - elif statement is used in nested conditional checks where we are checking for more than one or two conditions .\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","  - for loops is used when the number of iterations are known.\n","  - while loops are used when the number of iterations are unknown.\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","  - the use of while loop is more suitable when we dont know how many times we have to run the loop means the number of iterations are unknown.\n","  - For example : if we checking for whether the user has entered the correct password or not, in this case the use of while loops is better.\n","
